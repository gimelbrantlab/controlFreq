\title{Selecting particular replicates from a table with threshold on coverage}
\usage{
thresholdingCounts(df, reps = NA, thr = NA, thrUP = NA, thrType = "each")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Allele counts dataframe: with 2n+1 columns, "ID" and 2n columns with ref & alt counts (rep1_ref, rep1_alt, rep2_ref, rep2_alt, ...)}

\item{reps}{Optional (default=NA, all replicates), a vector of replicate numbers for which the analysis should be applied}

\item{thr}{Optional (default=NA), threshold on the overall number of counts for a gene to be considered in the analysis}

\item{thrUP}{Optional (default=NA), threshold for max gene coverage (default = NA)}

\item{thrType}{Optional (default = "each", also can be "average" for average coverage on replicates), threshold type}
}
\value{
Allelic counts table with masked with NA undercovered genes, for selected replicates
}
\description{
Takes allelic counts table and returns table, where all genes that don't pass a given coverage threshold have NA coverage. Can be restricted to particular replicates.
