# controlFreq
The elaborate method for quantification of allele-specific expression. 

This R-package performs **sample overdispersion estimation** from RNA spike-ins and technical replication. 

## Installation:
```
devtools::install_github("gimelbrantlab/controlFreq")
```
Dependencies: [Qllelic](https://github.com/gimelbrantlab/Qllelic)
